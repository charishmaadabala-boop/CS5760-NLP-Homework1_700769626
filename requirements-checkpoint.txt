### Dependencies

This project uses **spaCy**, an open-source Natural Language Processing (NLP) library
for Python. spaCy provides efficient and accurate tools for tokenization, part-of-speech
tagging, and other basic NLP tasks.

In this assignment, spaCy is used to perform automatic tokenization and to compare
tool-based tokenization with naïve and manually corrected tokenization approaches
(Question 5).

All required dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. The spaCy
English language model (`en_core_web_sm`) is required to run the tokenization code.

To install dependencies and the language model:

pip install -r requirements.txt  
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
